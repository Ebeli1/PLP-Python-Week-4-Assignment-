File Read & Write with Error Handling
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates file handling and error handling in Python.
The program creates a text file, reads its contents, processes the data, and writes a modified version to a new file while safely handling possible errors.

This assignment helps reinforce key Python concepts such as:

File creation

File reading and writing

String manipulation

Exception handling

🎯 Objectives

The main objectives of this program are to:

Create a text file and write data into it

Read text data from a file

Modify the file content (convert to uppercase)

Count the total number of words in the file

Write the processed content and word count to a new file

Handle errors gracefully if issues occur

🛠️ Program Features

Automatically creates an input.txt file with sample text

Prompts the user to enter a filename to read

Converts file content to uppercase

Counts the total number of words

Writes the processed content to output.txt

Displays meaningful error messages for common file issues

📂 Files Used
File Name	Description
input.txt	Input file created by the program
output.txt	Output file containing modified text and word count
index.py	Python script containing the program logic

How the Program Works (Step-by-Step)
Step 1: Create the Input File

The program first creates a file named input.txt and writes at least five lines of text into it.
This ensures the file exists before attempting to read it.

Step 2: User Input

The user is asked to enter the name of the file to read (e.g., input.txt).

Step 3: File Reading

The program attempts to open and read the specified file.

Step 4: Data Processing

All text is converted to uppercase

The total number of words is calculated using Python’s split() method

Step 5: Write to Output File

The processed text and word count are written to a new file called output.txt.

Step 6: Success Message

If everything works correctly, the program prints a confirmation message indicating successful file processing.

Error Handling

The program includes exception handling to manage common errors:

Error Type	Description
FileNotFoundError	Triggered if the file does not exist
PermissionError	Triggered if the file cannot be accessed
Exception	Catches any unexpected errors
This prevents the program from crashing and provides user-friendly feedback.
